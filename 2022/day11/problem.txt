PART 1
Monkey 0:
  Monkey inspects an item with a worry level of 79.
    Worry level is multiplied by 19 to 1501.
    Monkey gets bored with item. Worry level is divided by 3 to 500.
    Current worry level is not divisible by 23.
    Item with worry level 500 is thrown to monkey 3.
  Monkey inspects an item with a worry level of 98.
    Worry level is multiplied by 19 to 1862.
    Monkey gets bored with item. Worry level is divided by 3 to 620.
    Current worry level is not divisible by 23.
    Item with worry level 620 is thrown to monkey 3.

Monkey 0 inspected items 101 times.
Monkey 1 inspected items 95 times.
Monkey 2 inspected items 7 times.
Monkey 3 inspected items 105 times.

In this example, the two most active monkeys inspected items 101 and 105 times. 
The level of monkey business in this situation can be found by multiplying these together: 10605.

Figure out which monkeys to chase by counting how many items they inspect over 20 rounds. 
What is the level of monkey business after 20 rounds of stuff-slinging simian shenanigans?


PART 2

Worry levels are no longer divided by three after each item is inspected; you'll need to find another 
way to keep your worry levels manageable. Starting again from the initial 
state in your puzzle input, what is the level of monkey business after 10000 rounds?
