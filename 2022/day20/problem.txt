The encrypted file is a list of numbers. To mix the file, move each number forward or 
backward in the file a number of positions equal to the value of the number being moved. 
The list is circular, so moving a number off one end of the list wraps back around to the 
other end as if the ends were connected.

The numbers should be moved in the order they originally appear in the encrypted file. 
Numbers moving around during the mixing process do not change the order in which the numbers are moved.

1
2
-3
3
-2
0
4

Then, the grove coordinates can be found by looking at the 1000th, 2000th, and 3000th numbers after the 
value 0, wrapping around the list as necessary. In the above example, the 1000th number after 0 is 4, the 
2000th is -3, and the 3000th is 2; adding these together produces 3.

Mix your encrypted file exactly once. What is the sum of the three numbers that form the grove coordinates?
