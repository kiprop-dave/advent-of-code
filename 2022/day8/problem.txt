PART 1

Each tree is represented as a single digit whose value is its height, 
where 0 is the shortest and 9 is the tallest.

A tree is visible if all of the other trees between it and an edge of 
the grid are shorter than it. Only consider trees in the same row or 
column; that is, only look up, down, left, or right from any given tree.

Consider your map; how many trees are visible from outside the grid?
