PART 1

After simulating the rope, you can count up all of the positions the tail visited at 
least once. In this diagram, s again marks the starting position (which the tail also 
visited) and # marks other positions the tail visited:

..##..
...##.
.####.
....#.
s###..

So, there are 13 positions the tail visited at least once.

Simulate your complete hypothetical series of motions. How many positions does the tail 
of the rope visit at least once?
