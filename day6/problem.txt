PART 1

For example, suppose you receive the following datastream buffer:

mjqjpqmgbljsphdztnvjfqwrcgsmlb

After the first three characters (mjq) have been received, there haven't 
been enough characters received yet to find the marker. The first time a 
marker could occur is after the fourth character is received, making the 
most recent four characters mjqj. Because j is repeated, this isn't a marker.
The first time a marker appears is after the seventh character arrives. Once 
it does, the last four characters received are jpqm, which are all different. 
In this case, your subroutine should report the value 7, because the first 
start-of-packet marker is complete after 7 characters have been processed.

How many characters need to be processed before the first start-of-packet marker is detected?

PART 2

A start-of-message marker is just like a start-of-packet marker, except it consists of 14 distinct characters rather than 4.

Here are the first positions of start-of-message markers for all of the above examples:

    mjqjpqmgbljsphdztnvjfqwrcgsmlb: first marker after character 19
    bvwbjplbgvbhsrlpgdmjqwftvncz: first marker after character 23
    nppdvjthqldpwncqszvftbrmjlhg: first marker after character 23
    nznrnfrfntjfmvfwmzdfjlvtqnbhcprsg: first marker after character 29
    zcfzfwzzqfrljwzlrfnpqdbhtmscgvjw: first marker after character 26

How many characters need to be processed before the first start-of-message marker is detected?
